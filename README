Welcome to Hermes2D!

Hermes2D is a C++ library for rapid prototyping of space- and 
space-time adaptive hp-FEM solvers. Novel PDE-independent 
hp-adaptivity algorithms allow you to solve a large variety 
of PDE problems ranging from stationary linear equations to 
complex time-dependent nonlinear multiphysics PDE systems 
(see videos). The library is developed in collaboration with 
CSE experts, it follows newest trends in software engineering, 
and it comes with a free interactive online lab powered by UNR 
computing facilities. Detailed tutorial  enhanced with many 
benchmarks  and examples allow you to use Hermes2D without 
being expert in object-oriented programming, finite element 
methods, or in the theory of partial differential equations. 
Plus, there is a very active user community  where you will 
get help quickly.
