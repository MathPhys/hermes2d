Default solution method is *non-adaptive*. To run adaptive:
./newton-np-timedep-adapt-system adapt

Notice that the adaptive version requires pressing key to continue i.e. the graphs are renewed and calculation is stopped
after each iteration.

To compile a video:
mencoder "mf://velocity*.bmp" -mf fps=20 -o velocity.avi -ovc lavc -lavcopts vcodec=mpeg4

To make sure that widnows can show it, use 
vcodec=msmpeg4v2

To use eclipse as debugger, go to the root folder of the project and:
mkdir eclipse_build
cd eclipse_build
cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../

And in eclipse:
Import project using Menu File->Import
Select General->Existing projects into workspace:
Browse where your build tree is and select the root build tree directory. Keep "Copy projects into workspace" unchecked.
